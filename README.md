# To Do List

A to-do list is a simple yet powerful tool that helps individuals or groups organize their tasks and responsibilities. It serves as a central place to jot down tasks, assignments, and projects that need to be completed. Users can add items to the list, set priorities, and mark tasks as done when they are completed
